A place for machine learning geeks to find another geek's fun projects

In this repository, I keep some machine learning projects I work on to share with those who may find them interesting and would like to give valuable recommendations.

1. CreditFraudDetection_Notebook_on_Kaggle.ipynb: Python notebook describing a project I recently finished on Kaggle. The project employs techiniques of logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and AdaBoost to detect fraudulent credit transactions. Data file can be downloaded through the link provided in notebook.
